 * The lock table, which provides methods to lock and unlock blocks.
 * If a transaction requests a lock that causes a conflict with an
 * existing lock, then that transaction is placed on a wait list.
 * There is only one wait list for all blocks.
 * When the last lock on a block is unlocked, then all transactions
 * are removed from the wait list and rescheduled.
 * If one of those transactions discovers that the lock it is waiting for
 * is still locked, it will place itself back on the wait list.
