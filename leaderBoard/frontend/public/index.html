      The leaderboard shows the best recorded time for each user for all
      benchmarks cumulatively in the first tab, and for each one of the 8
      available benchmarks individually in the following tabs. The CS165 testing
      suite is comprised of 33 tests and 8 benchmarks. Each benchmark is about:
      (B1) initial loading follows by inserts, (B2) a complex SQL query, (B3)
      loading with index creation, (B4) queries using indexes, (B5) shared
      scans, (B6) loading of files with skewed data and index creation (also
      used for the joins), (B7) a complex join query, and (B8)
      inserts/updates/deletes in a relation with an index.
